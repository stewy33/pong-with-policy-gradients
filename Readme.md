# Pong with Policy Gradients 🔨👷 

Code for an intro to RL workshop. You'll be training a simple RL agent to play pong using vanilla policy gradients 😮💯

Adapted from [http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and rewritten with PyTorch.

## Instructions

👩‍🏫 🗣 There are five `### TODO:` statements where you'll need to fill in short pieces of code (no longer than a few lines) defining the policy network and calculating the policy gradients.

It takes a few hours to converge, but you should see some improvement within a few minutes. If not, you probably have a bug. Check terminal output and make use of TensorBoard training graphs 📈

Solution and trained network in `solution (spoiler alert!)` folder - but try to do it yourself first! You got this 🤠

### Setup

Make sure you have a working Python >= 3.5 installation. Also make sure it is 64-bit. You can see what version you have if you just run `python`'s interactive prompt.

Install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment:

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

(P.S. you can leave the virtual environment by entering `deactivate` into the
terminal when you're done)

Install dependencies:

Then, just install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: on Windows pytorch may fail to install through the above command, and you then need to install manually with
```
pip install torch==1.6.0+cpu torchvision==0.7.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
See the [pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/) for more details.


### Running the Code

To run it yourself:

```bash
$ python pong.py [--render]
```

where `--render` is an optional flag that renders pong games and slows them down to a watchable speed.


To test:

```bash
$ python test.py
```

(the tests are a helpful guide, but only check the policy network, calculating discounted rewards, and don't guarantee correctness!)


To view [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) visualizations during training, open a separate terminal, activate the virtualenv, run

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir tensorboard_logs
```

and visit [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).
